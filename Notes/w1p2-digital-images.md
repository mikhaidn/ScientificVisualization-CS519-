# Digital Images
(Display-Derived Color Spaces)

Creating a digital image is a fundamental task in viz. Most modern digital displacys rely on a *raster* of *pixels*.

a *raster* is a grid of pixels
A *pixel* is the smallest controllable element of a digital image (Like the atom, before subatomic particles were discovered) 

Types of Displays
* LCD
* OLED

Device derived color space (RGB values)
RGB are **primaries**
The color of a pixel is specefied by a tuple of the values (R,G,B). Each value is referred to as a color channel and the value of the channel is the intensity from [0-1]

Sometimes there is a 4th channel, A, *alpha* is used for opacity

operations are linear combinations of all the forms of the space of all the colors
