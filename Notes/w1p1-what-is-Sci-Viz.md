# Intro to Scientific Visualization
TL;DR
"The purpose of computation is insight, not numbers."
"The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures"
Sci Vis is meant to communicate insight

Types of Visualization:
* Data Vis - Packing data points that have "spatial meaning" in a visual manner (temperature, size, count)
* Info Vis - Visualization of "non spatial" info (relations, etc)
* Visual Analytics 
* Sci Viz

Types of Sci Viz (in this course)
* Terrain Viz - global temp
* Volume Viz - Viewing 3d space in 2d space (screen)
* Isosurfaces - MRI data of a human knee
* Flow Visualization - 
* Tensor Field Viz - 
* Bioinformatics Viz -

Why Visualize (vs other forms of Computational Sci)
It can wiew/reveal patterns through the following manners
* Explore data and make decisions
* Communicate ideas 
* Generate Hypotheses
* Persuade or inspire

Use Cases
* CT Scans
* Pandemic spread
* Effectiveness of mask
* MISLEADING VISUALIZATIONS

**DO NOT USE A VISUALIZATION WHEN A TASK WOULD BE BETTER DONE WITHOUT IT**
